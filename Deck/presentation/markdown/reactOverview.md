# Quick Overview of React

React is a Javascript library for building reusable UI components.

By designing simple views for each state in your application, React will update and render only what's needed when your data changes.
 
 
React components implement a `render()` method that takes input data and returns what to display.

In addition to taking input data (via `this.props`), a component can maintain its own internal state data (via `this.state`)

With `props` and `state` together, we can make components into applications
